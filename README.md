*   **Quick Access Script**: üöÄ Utilize `openNote.sh` for swift command-line access to your study materials.
*   **Practical Programming Examples**: üí° Dive into `C#` and `Shell` programming exercises (`progEa`, `progGy`, `impProgEa`, `impProgGy`) to solidify your understanding.
*   **Mathematical Foundations**: ‚ûï Explore `matAlap` (Mathematical Fundamentals) for core concepts and problem-solving.
*   **System Fundamentals**: üñ•Ô∏è Review `szamRend` (Number Systems/Computer Architecture) for essential computing knowledge.


## üöÄ Installation Guide

To get a local copy of uniNotes up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
*   **Shell Environment**: A Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, WSL for Windows) to run shell scripts.
*   **.NET SDK**: If you plan to compile and run the C# programs.

### Manual Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the `uniNotes` repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/szasz-roland/uniNotes.git
    cd uniNotes
    ```

2.  **Make Shell Scripts Executable**:
    Ensure the `openNote.sh` script (and any other `.sh` scripts) has execute permissions:

    ```bash
    chmod +x openNote.sh
    ```

3.  **C# Programs (Optional)**:
    If you wish to compile or run the C# programs (e.g., in `progEa`, `progGy`), navigate to their respective directories and use the .NET CLI:

    ```bash
    # Example for a C# project named 'MyCSharpProject'
    cd progEa/MyCSharpProject
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```


## üí° Usage Examples

### Accessing Notes with `openNote.sh`

The `openNote.sh` script is designed to help you quickly open specific note directories.

1.  **List available modules/notes**:

    ```bash
    ./openNote.sh help
    ```

2.  **Open a specific module's directory**:
    This will open the directory in your default file explorer or terminal, depending on your system configuration.

    ```bash
    ./openNote.sh matAlap
    ```

    Or for programming exercises:

    ```bash
    ./openNote.sh progEa
    ```

### Browsing Manually

You can also navigate through the project structure directly using your file explorer or terminal:

```bash
# To see all available folders
ls -F

# To go into a specific course material
cd matAlap
ls
```

### Running C# Examples

For C# projects, navigate to the project directory and use `dotnet run`:

```bash
cd progEa/example_csharp_project # Replace with actual project path
dotnet run
```


## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

The `uniNotes` project is continuously evolving. Here are some planned future enhancements:

*   **Version 1.1.0**:
    *   Add more subjects and course materials.
    *   Expand `C#` and `Shell` programming examples with more complex scenarios.
    *   Implement a search function within `openNote.sh` to find notes by keyword.
*   **Version 1.2.0**:
    *   Introduce documentation for each programming example.
    *   Integrate a simple web-based interface for browsing notes (optional, long-term).
    *   Add unit tests for C# code examples where applicable.
*   **Future Goals**:
    *   Incorporate notes for additional primary languages.
    *   Community contributions for new subjects and improved content.


## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to `uniNotes`! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the `uniNotes` repository to your GitHub account.
2.  **Create a New Branch**:
    *   For new features: `feature/your-feature-name`
    *   For bug fixes: `fix/issue-description`
    *   For documentation: `docs/update-description`
3.  **Code Style**:
    *   **Shell Scripts**: Follow common shell scripting best practices (e.g., ShellCheck recommendations, clear variable names, comments).
