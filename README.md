## üöÄ Installation Guide

To get a local copy of uniNotes up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
*   **Shell Environment**: A Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, WSL for Windows) to run shell scripts.
*   **.NET SDK**: If you plan to compile and run the C# programs.

### Manual Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the `uniNotes` repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/szasz-roland/uniNotes.git
    cd uniNotes
    ```

2.  **Make Shell Scripts Executable**:
    Ensure the `openNote.sh` script (and any other `.sh` scripts) has execute permissions:

    ```bash
    chmod +x openNote.sh
    ```

3.  **C# Programs (Optional)**:
    If you wish to compile or run the C# programs (e.g., in `progEa`, `progGy`), navigate to their respective directories and use the .NET CLI:

    ```bash
    # Example for a C# project named 'MyCSharpProject'
    cd progEa/MyCSharpProject
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```


## üí° Usage Examples

### Accessing Notes with `openNote.sh`

The `openNote.sh` script is designed to help you quickly open specific note directories.

1.  **List available modules/notes**:

    ```bash
    ./openNote.sh help
    ```

2.  **Open a specific module's directory**:
    This will open the directory in your default file explorer or terminal, depending on your system configuration.

    ```bash
    ./openNote.sh matAlap
    ```

    Or for programming exercises:

    ```bash
    ./openNote.sh progEa
    ```

### Browsing Manually

You can also navigate through the project structure directly using your file explorer or terminal:

```bash
# To see all available folders
ls -F

# To go into a specific course material
cd matAlap
ls
```

### Running C# Examples

For C# projects, navigate to the project directory and use `dotnet run`:

```bash
cd progEa/example_csharp_project # Replace with actual project path
dotnet run
```
